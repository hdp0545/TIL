			<h1>Defining Ajax</h1>
			<p>Ajax isn’t a technology. It’s really several technologies, each flourishing in its own right, coming together in powerful new ways. Ajax incorporates:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>standards-based presentation using XHTML and CSS;</li>
				<li>dynamic display and interaction using the Document Object Model;</li>
				<li>data interchange and manipulation using XML and XSLT;</li>
				<li>asynchronous data retrieval using XMLHttpRequest;</li>
				<li>and JavaScript binding everything together.</li>
			</ul>

			<hr></hr>

			<p>The classic web application model works like this: Most user actions in the interface trigger an HTTP request back to a web server. The server does some processing—retrieving data, crunching numbers, talking to various legacy systems—and then returns an HTML page to the client. It’s a model adapted from the Web’s original use as a hypertext medium, but as fans of The Elements of User Experience know, what makes the Web good for hypertext doesn’t necessarily make it good for software applications.</p>
